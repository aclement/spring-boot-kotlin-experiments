= Spring Boot Kotlin experiments

This repo contains a Spring Boot application written in Kotlin
exercising rudimentary Spring MVC and Spring Data REST.

The key interesting parts are:
- the main Application.kt file
- the Customer.kt domain object
- the CustomerRepository.kt CrudRepository

The same testcase is shown in Kotlin and in Java.

Fire it up with:
mvn spring-boot:run

and then

curl localhost:8080/greeting?name=foo

or 

curl localhost:8080/customers

This was also used to test out the eclipse support for Kotlin which does
behave for working on this application.

Disclaimer: I'm experimenting with Kotlin, I'm sure this isn't perfect
Kotlin code!
